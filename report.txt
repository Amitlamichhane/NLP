How do you implement evaluate()?
Exhaustive pattern matching was the way to go.


How does Modification 1 (i.e., storing model with best performance on the development set) affect the performance?
(what happens after putting config1)

How do you implement new_LSTMCell()?
How does Modification 2 (i.e., re-implemented LSTM cell) affect the performance?




How do you implement get_char_sequence()?
How does Modification 3 (i.e., adding Char BiLSTM layer) affect the performance?
